### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10+
- Anytype desktop app (v0.44.13-beta or higher) running during authentication

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Authentication

``` python
from anytype import Anytype

# Initialize client (first run triggers authentication)
any = Anytype()
any.auth()  # 🔑 Enter 4-digit code from Anytype app when prompted
``` 
2. Create Your First Object

``` python
from anytype import Object

# Get your workspace
spaces = any.get_spaces()
my_space = spaces[0]  # Use your preferred space

# Create a new page
note_type = my_space.get_type("Page")
new_note = Object()
new_note.name = "My Python-Powered Note 📝"
new_note.icon = "🔥"
new_note.description = "Automatically generated via Python API"

# Add rich content
new_note.add_title1("Welcome to Automated Knowledge Management!")
new_note.add_text("This section was created programmatically using:")

# Commit to workspace
created_object = my_space.create_object(new_note, note_type)
print(f"Created object: {created_object.id}")
```
